## What is Node.js?

**Definition:**
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on the server side.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine a busy coffee shop where a single barista takes orders, makes coffee, and serves customers. Instead of waiting for one coffee to finish before taking the next order, the barista takes multiple orders and prepares them as ingredients become available. Node.js works similarly by handling multiple requests efficiently without waiting for one to finish before starting another.

**Fun Fact:**
Node.js was created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl and has since become one of the most popular platforms for building scalable network applications.

### Key Points:
- **JavaScript Everywhere:** Use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.
- **Single Language:** No need to learn different languages for different parts of your application.
- **Fast & Efficient:** Built on Google's V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript to machine code.

> **Analogy:** Like a coffee shop barista who multitasks, Node.js can handle multiple requests at once without getting stuck on one order.

## Why use Node.js?

**Definition:**
Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

**Definition:**
Event-driven architecture means the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.

**Real-World Example:**
Think of a customer service call center. Calls (events) come in, and agents (handlers) respond as they become available, rather than making callers wait in a strict line.

```javascript
// Traditional approach (like a single phone line)
// One call at a time, others wait

// Node.js approach (like a call center)
// Multiple calls handled as agents become available
```

**What this means:** Node.js can handle multiple tasks at the same time, improving efficiency.

### 2. Non-Blocking I/O

**Definition:**
Non-blocking I/O allows other operations to continue while input/output operations are being performed.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you order food at a fast-food restaurant. Instead of waiting at the counter for your food, you get a number and sit down. When your food is ready, they call your number. This way, the restaurant can serve more people efficiently.

```javascript
// Blocking (old way)
const result = readFileSync('data.txt'); // Everything stops here
console.log('This waits until file is read');

// Non-blocking (Node.js way)
readFile('data.txt', (err, data) => {
    console.log('File read complete');
});
console.log('This runs immediately!');
```

### 3. Single-Threaded but Powerful

**Definition:**
Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop to handle multiple concurrent clients, making it lightweight and efficient.

**Real-World Example:**
A librarian (single thread) manages book checkouts for many students by quickly switching between them, rather than serving one student at a time until finished.

> **Why Single-Threaded?**: Like a librarian who can help many students by quickly switching between them, Node.js can handle many requests efficiently.

**Fun Fact:**
Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle thousands of concurrent connections thanks to its event-driven model.

## Installing Node.js & npm

**Definition:**
Node.js is the runtime, and npm (Node Package Manager) is the tool for managing JavaScript packages.

### Step 1: Download Node.js
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS version** (Long Term Support)
3. Run the installer

### Step 2: Verify Installation
Open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see something like:
```
v18.17.0
9.6.7
```

### What is npm?

**Definition:**
npm is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage libraries and tools for your projects.

**Real-World Example:**
npm is like an app store for JavaScript code, where you can download and manage reusable code packages for your projects.

```bash
# Installing a package
npm install express

# Creating a new project
npm init
```

## Understanding the Node.js Runtime and V8 Engine

### The V8 Engine

**Definition:**
The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google, used in Chrome and Node.js to execute JavaScript code.

**Real-World Example:**
V8 is like a high-performance car engine that makes your car (JavaScript code) run fast and efficiently.

**Fun Fact:**
V8 compiles JavaScript directly to machine code before executing it, making it extremely fast.

### Node.js Runtime Architecture

**Definition:**
The Node.js runtime provides the environment and tools needed to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Your JavaScript Code      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Node.js Runtime           │
│  ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐   │
│  │   V8 Engine │ │ Event Loop  │   │
│  └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Operating System          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Analogy:**
- **V8 Engine:** The car engine
- **Event Loop:** The driver who manages all the routes
- **Node.js Runtime:** The whole car system
- **Your Code:** The instructions for the trip

## First Node.js Script

### 1. Hello World!

**Definition:**
A simple script to print a message to the console, demonstrating how to run JavaScript with Node.js.

Create a file called `hello.js`:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js World!");
console.log("Welcome to the amazing world of backend development!");
```

Run it:
```bash
node hello.js
```

### 2. Creating a Simple Server

**Definition:**
A basic HTTP server in Node.js can respond to web requests, showing how Node.js can be used for web development.

**Real-World Example:**
Like opening a lemonade stand where you serve drinks (web pages) to customers (users) who visit your stand (server).

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    res.end(`
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>My First Node.js Server</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Welcome to My Node.js Server!</h1>
                <p>Your server is running successfully!</p>
                <p>Current time: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}</p>
            </body>
        </html>
    `);
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is open! Visit: http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    console.log(`Server started at: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}`);
});
```

**What this does:**
1. **Creates a server** (like opening a lemonade stand)
2. **Listens for requests** (like waiting for customers)
3. **Serves HTML content** (like serving drinks)
4. **Runs on port 3000** (like having a specific address)

### 3. Running Your Server

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

> **Pro Tip:** `localhost` means "this computer" - like saying "my house" instead of your full address.

## Understanding process, __dirname, __filename

### The `process` Object

**Definition:**
The `process` object provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.

**Real-World Example:**
The `process` object is like your computer's dashboard, showing details like your username, current directory, and environment.

```javascript
console.log('Process ID:', process.pid);
console.log('Node.js Version:', process.version);
console.log('Platform:', process.platform);
console.log('Current Directory:', process.cwd());
```

### __dirname and __filename

**Definition:**
`__dirname` is the directory name of the current module, and `__filename` is the file name of the current module.

**Real-World Example:**
`__dirname` is like your home address, and `__filename` is like your exact room number in your house.

```javascript
console.log('Current file location:', __filename);
console.log('Current folder location:', __dirname);
```

### Practical Example: File Paths

```javascript
const path = require('path');

console.log('File directory:', __dirname);
const dataFile = path.join(__dirname, 'data.txt');
console.log('Data file path:', dataFile);
console.log('File name:', path.basename(__filename));
console.log('File extension:', path.extname(__filename));
```

### Complete Example: File Explorer

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

console.log('File Explorer Information:');
console.log('=============================');
console.log(`Current Directory: ${process.cwd()}`);
console.log(`Current File: ${__filename}`);
console.log(`File Directory: ${__dirname}`);
console.log(`File Name: ${path.basename(__filename)}`);
console.log(`File Extension: ${path.extname(__filename)}`);

fs.readdir(__dirname, (err, files) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading directory:', err);
        return;
    }
    files.forEach(file => {
        const filePath = path.join(__dirname, file);
        const stats = fs.statSync(filePath);
        const type = stats.isDirectory() ? 'DIR' : 'FILE';
        console.log(`${type} ${file}`);
    });
});
```
