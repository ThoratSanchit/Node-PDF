## API Security Basics (Helmet, CORS, rate-limiting)

**Definition:**
API security involves protecting your application’s endpoints from unauthorized access, attacks, and misuse.

**Helmet:**
Helmet is a middleware for Express that sets various HTTP headers to help secure your app.
```js
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
```

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**
CORS controls which domains can access your API. By default, browsers block requests from different origins for security.
```js
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://your-frontend.com' }));
```

**Rate Limiting:**
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame, protecting against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
```

**Real-World Example:**
Think of a security guard (Helmet) checking IDs, a bouncer (CORS) only letting in people from certain companies, and a ticket counter (rate-limiting) only selling a certain number of tickets per hour.

**Fun Fact:**
Helmet can help prevent over 10 common web vulnerabilities with just one line of code.

## Authentication (JWT-based auth step-by-step)

**Definition:**
Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity. JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe way to represent claims between two parties.

**Step-by-Step JWT Auth:**
1. User logs in with username and password.
2. Server verifies credentials and creates a JWT.
3. JWT is sent to the client and stored (usually in localStorage or a cookie).
4. Client sends JWT in the Authorization header for protected requests.
5. Server verifies the JWT before allowing access to protected routes.

**Example:**
```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, 'secretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
// To verify:
jwt.verify(token, 'secretKey');
```

**Real-World Example:**
JWT is like a movie ticket: once you have it, you can show it to enter the theater (protected route) until it expires.

## Hashing passwords with bcrypt

**Definition:**
Hashing is the process of converting a password into a fixed-length string of characters, which is nearly impossible to reverse. bcrypt is a popular library for hashing passwords in Node.js.

**Example:**
```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const hashed = await bcrypt.hash('myPassword', 10);
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare('myPassword', hashed);
```

**Real-World Example:**
Hashing is like shredding a document—once shredded, you can’t put it back together, but you can compare shreds to see if they came from the same document.

**Fun Fact:**
bcrypt automatically adds a random “salt” to each password, making it even more secure.

---

## Protecting private routes

**Definition:**
Private routes are endpoints that require authentication. Only users with valid tokens can access them.

**Example:**
```js
function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Access denied');
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secretKey');
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid token');
  }
}
app.get('/private', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a private route');
});
```

**Real-World Example:**
A private route is like a VIP lounge—only people with the right wristband (token) can enter.

---

## Role-based access control (Admin/User)

**Definition:**
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts what users can do based on their assigned roles (e.g., admin, user).

**Example:**
```js
function adminMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin') return res.status(403).send('Admins only');
  next();
}
app.delete('/admin/delete-user', authMiddleware, adminMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // delete logic
});
```

**Real-World Example:**
RBAC is like different access cards in an office—some open every door (admin), some only open certain rooms (user).

---

## Pagination and filtering

**Definition:**
Pagination breaks large sets of data into smaller pages. Filtering allows users to search or narrow down results.

**Example:**
```js
// Pagination
const page = parseInt(req.query.page) || 1;
const limit = parseInt(req.query.limit) || 10;
const users = await User.find().skip((page - 1) * limit).limit(limit);

// Filtering
const filtered = await User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } });
```

**Real-World Example:**
Pagination is like a book’s table of contents—showing a few chapters at a time. Filtering is like searching for all chapters about a specific topic.

---

## Express error handling best practices

**Definition:**
Error handling ensures your app responds gracefully to problems, providing useful feedback without crashing.

**Example:**
```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use centralized error handling middleware
- Don’t leak sensitive info in error messages
- Log errors for debugging

**Real-World Example:**
Error handling is like a car’s airbag—it protects users when something goes wrong.

---

## Project structure for scalable apps

**Definition:**
A well-organized project structure makes your app easier to maintain and scale.

**Example Structure:**
```
project-root/
  controllers/
  models/
  routes/
  middlewares/
  utils/
  app.js
  package.json
```

**Real-World Example:**
A good project structure is like a well-organized kitchen—everything has its place, making cooking (coding) efficient.

**Fun Fact:**
Many large companies use similar folder structures for their Node.js apps.

---

## Deploying Node.js App (Railway, Render, Vercel, or Heroku)

**Definition:**
Deployment is the process of making your app available on the internet. Platforms like Railway, Render, Vercel, and Heroku make this easy.

**Steps:**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to the deployment platform
3. Configure environment variables (like database URLs)
4. Deploy and monitor your app

**Real-World Example:**
Deploying is like opening your restaurant to the public after setting up the kitchen and menu.

---

## Git & GitHub basics for deployment (.gitignore, package.json scripts)

**Definition:**
Git is a version control system; GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code.

**.gitignore:**
Specifies files/folders Git should ignore (like node_modules, .env).

**package.json scripts:**
Custom commands for running, building, or deploying your app.
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon app.js"
}
```

**Real-World Example:**
.gitignore is like a do-not-pack list for a trip. package.json scripts are like shortcuts for common tasks.
